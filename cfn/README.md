This package contains struct definitions for [AWS Resource Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)

**Don't put anything else here.**

## Organization

For a resource type `AWS::ResourceGroup::ResourceName` you can find a lowercase
version of the ResourceGroup as a package, and the lowercase version of
ResourceName as a file.

```
cfn
└── resource_group
    └── resource_name.go
```
